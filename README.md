In this project i merged 3 datasets to identify the most popular movies and tv shows in Netflix according to IMDb ratings, to answer the following questions using data exploratory analysis:
1) Which countries have the greatest amount of top rated Movies and TV Shows?          
2) Which genre of the best rated Movies and TV Shows?  
3) What the top 10 most popular Movies and TV Shows?  
4) What the top 3 most popular Movies and TV Shows per year of release?
